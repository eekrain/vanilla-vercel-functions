# üç¶ vanilla-vercel-functions examples

An example project for using Vercel Serverless Functions and Edge Functions with vanilla Node.js (without Next.js).

## Getting Started

You should install `vercel` CLI, if you haven't installed yet.

### Setup

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm start # script can't be `dev` because of a `vercel` CLI constraint
```

When you run `pnpm start` for the first time, a prompt for vercel project settings should appear, so please configure it.

Then, you can see your API is running at http://localhost:3000/api/hello.

### Deploy

```bash
vercel deploy
```

**By default, project region is set to `hnd1` (Tokyo). You can choose other regions in `vercel.json`**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Sample visitor-count features is based on `ctx.waitUntil`, but it doesn't seem to work properly on dev server. It would work on production.**

## Environment Variables

You can use `.env` file locally.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

In production, you should set environment variables via `vercel env` command, or on dashboard.

## Static Files

Vercel support static file serving in `public` directory (by default).
